					<p>So good morning everybody and we have a lot to talk about today.</p>
					<p>So, let's see we have a few things that are starting to come up now for Biz dev. Thanks to Nathan.  We're starting to have some tickets for that, that sort of thing so. The first thing that's going come up is the gym pass landing page, which they'd like us to start working on soon. But obviously before we start working on that, I'd really like to see if we could finish up some other things so.</p>
					<p>Tyree, I want to talk with you first to see how things are going with the website and how your timing looks with that.</p>

					<p>I am still on track for being done on Friday. If everybody does all the reviews and comes back with stuff that isn't crazy. Granted, if they do then it'll still get done. But the sooner everybody gets stuff back to me, the better. There were some things that, to name Kristina, and I've been working on those and fixing those on the landing page. </p>
					<p>She asked me this morning when she could review those on Alpha, but the sign-up page is up as well. If you're wanting to look at things you can go and test the sign-up page and I think I let you all know that last week. So, if you guys want to test that out, that is in my opinion, probably the more difficult piece.</p>
					<p>That one has more moving parts. It requires payments, is actually where all the work we've done pays off, right? So yeah, if you if she wants to review that. If you want to review that. If you want to put Seth on that or QA team, go right on ahead. And if you can get it back, you know whatever you find by tomorrow, then I should be good to go by Friday and I'll try to push out something at the end of the day today with the rest of the changes for the main site. I fixed all the styling and things like the responsiveness.</p>
					<p>But yeah, that's all been finished and now I guess there's something about they want a video to loop inside of the iPad itself? So, I'm going to spend a little bit of time on that, but I want to make sure that there's enough time to get the actual site done. Like in my opinion like having the full site completed and looking good is infinitely more important than a video being inside of an iPad uh-huh the video works, it just isn't. You know it's not in sitting inside of an iPad is all it is.</p>
					<p>I want to make sure I get everything else done for that. So yeah that's where I'm at. It's good to go. Like I said, if we can get tested on the on the accounts page. That would be helpful for keeping everything on track.</p>

					<p>OK, perfect. OK, and so the gym pass thing. My understanding is what they want is basically a duplicate of the Girl Scout page with their branding. I've gone back to Nathan to see if we can get assets from them. But beyond that, I don't know the level of effort exactly for just redoing the Girl Scout Page and making it gym pass.</p>

					<p>Yeah, it's a little more complicated. But not too bad. So, they're going to send their basically once, when a customer signs up through them. They're going to have a a link that's unique, OK, and pass encrypted data with the user information like the email the Gym Pass ID whatever, so we will need to create a page that grabs that info. Whatever else we need to ask if we want to ask for the kid code or info like how old is your kid? What's their experience?</p>
					<p>We'll need to have them set a password. But the user name should be their email, so that should be displayed but locked out and then once they hit submit. Basically, I need to write a function on the server to create a user and make them a subscriber and tie them to gym pass so that we know that they are a gym pass user.</p>
					<p>We're not going to check their status; we're just going to assume there are subscriber. Gym pass: this is a pilot program, so it's going to run for a few months. We're going to send them data of like who logs in, who's an actual active user, and then if it's popular, we'll roll it out to a bigger group.</p>
					<p>So will need to send events to Mixpanel. Will need to write script, and this is probably David writing a script to compile all the active users and then we need to upload that like at the beginning of every month.</p>
					<p>And then whenever the user like logs into the app, they should just be able to play. We just assume they're active, and then if this. If this doesn't work out we'll just cancel everybody. If it's wildly successful, then I think Gym Pass would need to tell us who canceled and who renewed and all that stuff eventually. But there's no plans for that yet. If you want to create a ticket, I can create a duplicate ticket in the dev channel.</p>

					<p>OK, I found it. So I'll what I can do is I can write tickets and web devs that we can have the right statuses, but I'll link it to this ticket and then I'll write all the subtasks and try to estimate. It will be a little bit Tyree’s time, David's time, my time. We could possibly use role on this to help out depending on.</p>
					<p>Well, I have to break it up into more sub tasks, but it's not. I've already tested their encryption, so that's not a big deal.</p>
					<p>I already have a little test file that because they asked me to do that to just make sure it worked OK. Yeah, that that's that. This will be good to probably start as soon as we can, OK?</p>

					<p>Yeah, my life is all like meetings and interviews right now. Seth found one thing for the six month recurring subscription. Which is in the nightly script that I was going to fix. I wanted to walk David through that, but I don't have time today, it doesn't matter until we make an offer on live so we have like time, but I want to get it done like Friday tomorrow when I have less meetings.</p>
					<p>OK, and then I was going to look at the subscription upgrades. But like with all this stuff coming up, I don't know whether the priority is between that and like Gym Pass. And I saw this morning, uh, We Grow ticket from Nathan.</p>
					<p>We also had a talk with Sam's Club on Monday that looks it's not super like urgent, but they want try to deliver it like in December and for Q1 launch like. Give them January to like test it and whatever they seem very slow, you know they’re corporate. Yeah, so that's the stuff I know about.</p>

					<p>Yeah, I think for now we're going to have to switch over to doing a little bit of this biz dev stuff just to get it set up. But then I want to switch back because there are some things that. I know I'd really like to get the customer service tool finished as well.</p>

					<p>Yeah, I mean I don't want to steal people's updates, but the chart mobile stuff. It looks like it's pretty much done. We're just trying to deploy it today. It's going to log stuff and then I wanted to hand it off to David since he should be in charge of data. You can decide to push this live and connect it to chart mobile.</p>
					<p>I'm also thinking the same thing for the nightly script. OK, which like kind of frees up Raul, so we should think about stuff for him. And there's a list, he could also be helping with these integrations.</p>
					<p>And one thing I was thinking to do is I kind of want to make a generic user creation script for all these partners, because there's a little bit in common of make a user, give them a subscription, set the store to like the partner name, set the partner and Mixpanel. I'm kinda rambling at this point, but that's what I was thinking to focus on after.</p>
					<p>But again, I don't know where the subscription upgrades fits in with all this. How important is that to Kristina? Because I don't understand how to do it on the server side, but I don't know where on the website they go to upgrade their subscription? We need a page for that and that's not designed.</p>

					<p>That would be in in the accounts when you log in and you look at what your account status is. At that place it would be there and then it would probably later also be in the app. Where you check your status on it. If you need me to write a ticket for where that would go.</p>

					<p>No, just to reiterate what he said is. Yeah, we are already or like we deployed a version of that webhook that the thing that I was working on, uh? There's some bugs right now is I'm going through those and fixing them. But yeah, it looks like we're on track to finish that by the end of the week at least.</p>

					<p>OK, cool, well we're definitely starting to shift up a gear, so we're going to need to get a little bit tighter with our work in our deployment, so if there's ways that I can help figure out better ways to hand off from you guys to Seth or having approvals from Kristina or whoever the approvals from, let's work on that because we're going to have some actual deadlines coming up?</p>
					<p>You know we're doing our best to keep them all pretty soft. An as much as we can, but it is going to be tight through probably mid December. And then we're going. And then we're definitely going to ease off for the second half of December for all for all of our sanity.</p>

					<p>Yes, so we started up the QA on the CS admin tool. Right now there about 15 bugs that are in there. I know of another one off the top of my head that I'm going to file in today and a lot of this stuff doesn't seem to quite work right, so I'm halting further testing on that until we go through the parts that.</p>
					<p>Already have a bugs in and then I'll come back and do the rest of it right now because there's a lack of functionality, so going and testing like every single individual parameter. At the moment, it is probably just going to be a time sink at, so whenever we reprioritize the second round of development on that and Preston and I can get back in there and get that done.</p>

					<p>OK, yeah, I mean QA's got a lot of different things that they can shuffle towards, so I don't want them to be burning cycles on something that probably needs a little bit more attention first.</p>
					<p>OK, well if there's nothing else from anybody I know we're all busy so I will let you go. You know where to find me, if you think of anything.</p>

					<p>Have one quick question that's not super important, but so far so originally in Clickup we have our web development in our DevOps in our tools folders under dev. Is it a huge deal to move them out to their own thing?</p>

					<p>No, that's fine. It's good to him for me here what we're all working on case like there's a lot of things that were in progress on that is probably better than he should have done. But he did. He wasn't here like two months ago. So yeah, it's definitely good for having at least listening to what's going on and OK. And then we can start giving him tickets and stuff soon.</p>
